## Overview of the analysis:
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
In this analysis, bike-sharing data from NYC Citi Bike August 2018 is transformed such that the columns are the appropriate data types (namely datetime). After this, the data was uploaded to Tableau to create an extensive analysis of the riders of these bikes and their habits. The compilation of this analysis was compiled into the following Story:

## Results:
### Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

In this analysis, the following breakdowns were created. From these we can draw the following conclusions:

Checkout Time for Users:
![Checkout Time for Users](https://github.com/waciciarelli/bikesharing/blob/main/Screenshots/Checkout%20Time%20for%20Users.png?raw=true)

Most bikes are checked out for less than 10 minutes.

Gender Breakdown:
![Gender Breakdown](https://github.com/waciciarelli/bikesharing/blob/main/Screenshots/Gender%20Breakdown.png?raw=true)

A majority of riders are male.

Checkout Time by Gender:

Gender does not seem to affect checkout time.

Trips by Weekday by each Hour:
![Trips by Weekday by each Hour](https://github.com/waciciarelli/bikesharing/blob/main/Screenshots/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20each%20hour.png?raw=true)

Peak hours for renting bikes are 11AM - 5PM on the weekends and 8AM and 5PM - 6PM on Weekdays.

Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour):
![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](https://github.com/waciciarelli/bikesharing/blob/main/Screenshots/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday).png?raw=true)

Gender does not affect the peak hours.

User Trips by Gender by Weekday:
![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/waciciarelli/bikesharing/blob/main/Screenshots/Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png?raw=true)

Male users consistently rent more bikes than female or unknown users and are typically subscribers.

Top Starting Locations:

The city is a prime location to focus placing bikes.

## Summary: 
### Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

From these results, I can conclude that males most commonly rent these bikes in short periods before and after work or throughout the day on weekends. Females typically have similar patterns as the men, but in lower numbers. If NYC Citi would like to combat this difference, they would do best to advertise to women in the city during these hours.

If I were to continue this analysis, I would like to run is a map of where female users are renting their bikes from to ensure the accuracy of these advertisements.

One additional analysis I would make is to make this same analysis for the end station of female users is. If there is a notable pattern with the end station as there is with the start station, advertising along this route would prove to be effective.
